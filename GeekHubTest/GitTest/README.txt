After my incredibly scrupulous and accurate assessment, I have come to the conclusion that your ability to undertake this certain task is subpar. In order to remedy this, we must begin a program of your self improvement. This, whilst it may sound like an arduous process, is rather simple. There is only one thing required of you: that you intentionally and continually strive to better yourself at the completion of this before said task. Now, to accomplish this will take high levels of dedication and practice, but after a long period of time, you will succeed. And on that day you may proclaim that you are finished, and that you may be able to continue your life as it was before this ordeal. You will look upon your past self with disgust, knowing the magnitude of your improvement. You will have moved on from that self, and reached an ascended state: you got good.
